 open.mp Includes
==================

Welcome to the official open.mp includes, vastly upgraded and improved from the original versions - more functions, more correctness, more compile-time checks.  open.mp is the culmination of years of gradual improvements, fixes, and hard-learnt best practices for pawn code and SA:MP.  It is the direct continuation of several projects all with the same aim - making online San Andreas better for everyone:

If you are completely new to Pawn programming [click here for the beginner documentation](/documentation/readme-beginner.md), showing you how to get your first server started: [readme-beginner.md](/documentation/readme-beginner.md)

If you are an expert at Pawn programming [click here for the expert documentation](/documentation/readme-expert.md), detailing all the changes made and their reasons:  [readme-expert.md](/documentation/readme-expert.md)

If you are somewhere in between [click here for the intermediate documentation](/documentation/readme-intermediate.md), which just tells you how to upgrade your code:  [readme-intermediate.md](/documentation/readme-intermediate.md)
